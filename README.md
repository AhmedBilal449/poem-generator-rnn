# poem-generator-rnn
A Poem Generator in Python that uses Recurrent Neural Networks. Uses TensorFlow and Numpy libraries. Uncomment the code used to train the model and comment everything below it. After the model has been trained remove the code needed to train the model as the model is now saved. Uncomment the code below and run it to see the generated text. Added multiple different printed texts that range from conservative to experimental.

Note:
A specific line has been added to limit the text used to train the model. If the model is taking too long to learn use that line to help the model train fast. This, however, will limit the dataset the model uses to train, leading to differing results.
